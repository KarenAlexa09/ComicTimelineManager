## Usage
1. **Setup in Unity:**

## Notes
- Ensure `StorySnippetsModel` contains all available story snippets before calling `Initialize()`.
- Unlocked snippets should be determined by the gameâ€™s progress tracking system.
- `PlayableDirectorPrefab` should be properly referenced to play story animations.

## Future Improvements
- Add support for saving snippet unlock states across sessions.
- Implement transitions between snippet playback and game UI.
- Optimize animation timing for better user experience.
